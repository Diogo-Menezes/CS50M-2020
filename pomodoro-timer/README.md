# Project 1 - Pomodoro Timer - Completed
For this project, you'll be implementing a Pomodoro timer. This timer will help
people trying to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
It will vibrate to tell you when to take breaks or resume working, based on some
determined values. Check out the [staff solution](#staff-solution) for a working
version.

## Tasks
- [x] Timer should display minutes and seconds in text
- [x] Timer should count down seconds until it reaches 00:00
- [x] Phone should buzz when timer reaches 0
- [x] Timers should switch between 25 and 5 minutes
- [x] Timer should be able to start, stop, and reset
- [x] (Challenge) Allow the user to input any arbitrary time for the timers (e.g. 5 mins of work time and 5 mins of break)

### Extras

- [x] The seconds can only go till 59 and the minutes till 99
