# Harvard University - CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native

### Course description

Learn about mobile app development with React Native, a popular framework maintained by Facebook that enables cross-platform native apps using JavaScript without Java or Swift.

This course picks up where CS50 leaves off, transitioning from web development to mobile app development with React Native.

The course introduces you to modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. Through hands-on projects, you'll gain experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course culminates in a final project for which you'll implement an app entirely of your own design
